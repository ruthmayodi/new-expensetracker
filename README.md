This voice powered expense tracker is built using React Hooks, Context API, Material UI and Speechly voice API for seamless intergration into the application. 

Created an expense tracker that  showcases State Management in React and Context API enabling the 
user to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application.

Applied Material UI framework to provide consistency in design for the application 
to look aesthetically appealing. 

Employed Speechly to enhance the application with voice functionalities for better user experience.
